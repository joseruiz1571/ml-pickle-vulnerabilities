# CVE-2025-10279: MLflow Deserialization Vulnerability

## Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **CVE ID** | CVE-2025-10279 |
| **Framework** | MLflow |
| **Affected Versions** | See vendor advisory |
| **Fixed Version** | See vendor advisory |
| **CVSS Score** | 7.0 (High) |
| **CWE** | CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) |
| **Attack Vector** | Local |
| **Disclosed** | 2026-02-02 |

## Summary

In mlflow version 2.20.3, the temporary directory used for creating Python virtual environments is assigned insecure world-writable permissions (0o777). This vulnerability allows an attacker with write access to the `/tmp` directory to exploit a race condition and overwrite `.py` files in the virtual environment, leading to arbitrary code execution. The issue is resolved in version 3.4.0.

## Technical Details

**Vulnerable Function:** To be documented

**Root Cause:** Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data allowing arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Pattern:**
1. Attacker crafts malicious serialized payload
2. Payload is loaded by vulnerable function
3. Deserialization triggers code execution
4. Arbitrary code executes with application privileges

## Proof of Concept

See NVD entry and vendor advisory for technical details.

## Remediation

### Immediate Actions

1. **Check if affected**: Review your dependencies for vulnerable versions
2. **Upgrade**: Apply vendor patches when available
3. **Audit**: Review code for usage of vulnerable functions

### Long-term Mitigations

- Use safe serialization formats (safetensors, JSON) instead of pickle
- Implement input validation and source verification
- Never deserialize data from untrusted sources

## GRC Implications

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** High

**Impact Scenarios:**
- Remote code execution on systems processing untrusted data
- Supply chain compromise through malicious model files
- Data exfiltration or system compromise

### Vendor Assessment Questions

1. "Do you use MLflow for model serialization?"
2. "What version of MLflow is deployed in production?"
3. "Are models loaded from untrusted or external sources?"
4. "What controls exist to validate model file integrity?"

### Control Recommendations

| Control | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Version upgrade | Apply security patches | High |
| Input validation | Verify model sources | High |
| Monitoring | Log model loading operations | Medium |
