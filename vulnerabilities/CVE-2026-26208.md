## Summary

ADB Explorer is a fluent UI for ADB on Windows. Prior to Beta 0.9.26020, ADB Explorer is vulnerable to Insecure Deserialization leading to Remote Code Execution. The application attempts to deserialize the App.txt settings file using Newtonsoft.Json with TypeNameHandling set to Objects. This allows an attacker to supply a crafted JSON file containing a gadget chain (e.g., ObjectDataProvider) to execute arbitrary code when the application launches and subsequently saves its settings. This vulnera...

## Technical Details

**Vulnerable Function:** To be documented

**Root Cause:** Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data allowing arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Pattern:**
1. Attacker crafts malicious serialized payload
2. Payload is loaded by vulnerable function
3. Deserialization triggers code execution
4. Arbitrary code executes with application privileges

## Proof of Concept

See NVD entry and vendor advisory for technical details.

## Remediation

### Immediate Actions

1. **Check if affected**: Review your dependencies for vulnerable versions
2. **Upgrade**: Apply vendor patches when available
3. **Audit**: Review code for usage of vulnerable functions

### Long-term Mitigations

- Use safe serialization formats (safetensors, JSON) instead of pickle
- Implement input validation and source verification
- Never deserialize data from untrusted sources

## GRC Implications

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** High

**Impact Scenarios:**
- Remote code execution on systems processing untrusted data
- Supply chain compromise through malicious model files
- Data exfiltration or system compromise

### Vendor Assessment Questions

1. "Do you use Unknown for model serialization?"
2. "What version of Unknown is deployed in production?"
3. "Are models loaded from untrusted or external sources?"
4. "What controls exist to validate model file integrity?"

### Control Recommendations

| Control | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Version upgrade | Apply security patches | High |
| Input validation | Verify model sources | High |
| Monitoring | Log model loading operations | Medium |
